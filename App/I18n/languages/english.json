   "aboutP2": "The reason why we decided to embark on this particular project was, in addition to contributing to the needs of the park and considering it a professional challenge, because we found the possibility of enriching the visitor experience. We believe it is useful to have information about the place at all times and also to have a tool that protects its users from possible loss.",
   "aboutP3": "The users to whom this application is aimed are mainly tourists. They can download and subsequently use the application off-line during the course of their stay in the park, having at their disposal all the services provided.",
   "importantP": "Remember, in case of Huemul sighting you must notify the Park staff.",
   "descriptionP": "It is a beautiful waterfall of pure water, which in its immense flow forms a lagoon. Crossing the forest, the jump is on the last stretch of the Chorrillo River before it flows into the De las Vueltas River."
